    <!--All HTML elements can have attributes
        Attributes provide additional information about elements
        Attributes are always specified in the start tag
        Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"-->
    
        <!--Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity 
    of the color with a value between 0 and 255.-->
    
    <!--For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set 
    to its highest value (255), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 0.

    Another example, rgb(0, 255, 0) is displayed as green, because green is set 
    to its highest value (255), and the other two (red and blue) are set to 0.-->

    <!--rgba(red, green, blue, alpha) The alpha parameter is a number 
    between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):-->

    <!--HEX Color Values: #rrggbb Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal 
    values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).
    
    For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff), 
    and the other two (green and blue) are set to 00.
    
    #00ff00 is displayed as green, because green is set to its highest value (ff), 
    and the other two (red and blue) are set to 00.-->

    <!--HSL Color Values: hsl(hue, saturation, lightness) 
    hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 
    0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
    
    Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 
    100% is the full color.
    
    Lightness is also a percentage value. 0% is black, and 100% is white.
    
    hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)

    The alpha parameter is a number between 
    0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all)-->
